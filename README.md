# Honest Thumbnails

Honest Thumbnails is a Chrome extension that replaces YouTube's uploader-chosen thumbnails with a real frame from the middle of each video.

> **Bilibili and Douyin are supported too.** The follow-up project, [封面避雷针 · Clickbait Cop](https://github.com/hiyanyang/clickbait-cop), applies the same idea to YouTube, Bilibili and Douyin — it reuses the preview images each platform already generates for its progress bar, so nothing gets downloaded.

## How it works

Besides the thumbnail the uploader picks, YouTube automatically saves three stills from every video, roughly a quarter, half and three-quarters of the way through. They live at predictable addresses:

| Image | Size | Availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `i.ytimg.com/vi/<id>/maxres1.jpg`, `maxres2.jpg`, `maxres3.jpg` | 1280×720 | HD videos |
| `i.ytimg.com/vi/<id>/hq1.jpg`, `hq2.jpg`, `hq3.jpg` | 480×360 | every video |

Honest Thumbnails finds each thumbnail on the page and swaps it for the chosen frame. It tries the HD version first, falls back to the smaller one, and keeps the original if neither exists. Everything happens in your browser. The idea comes from [HackerTube](https://hackertube.org/), which uses the same mid-video frame.

**It covers:**
- the home feed, search results, channel pages and the watch-page sidebar
- the video player's preview image and the grid of videos shown when a video ends
- embedded players on `youtube.com` and `youtube-nocookie.com`

**Limitations:**
- **It's a fixed point, not a smart pick.** If the middle of a video is a title card, a black screen or a sponsor segment, that's what you'll see. Try the Early or Late frame instead.
- **"Roughly the middle" is approximate.** YouTube doesn't document exactly when these frames are taken.
- **Static videos look the same.** For podcasts with a cover image or music uploads with album art, the frame is the same image as before.

## Privacy

No account, no analytics, no tracking. The extension never sends data anywhere. It only loads images from YouTube's own image server, and it only stores your on/off setting and frame choice. It runs only on YouTube. See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md).
